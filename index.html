		<h2><span>BEYOND</span></h2>
<img src="images/pys.jpg" height="300" width="500" align="left">
<p> From the book challenging partriarchy I have gained courage to stand against the norms that are there to put a woman down, slow her growth or completely deminish it. A while back there was this friend of mine who was married but it wasn't working out for her and she wanted to opt out and go back to school, the elders were called to try and sort out the issues they were having, the girl gave her reasons that she wanted to go back to school, the father-in-law was like, school can wait, she should concentrate on her marriage since he wanted to have many grandchildren playing at his feet calling him grand dad. That hit me deep because a woman is not a vessel for procreation only, she has a life and purpose in this life to accomplish. Yes! Culture is there but it shouldn't be an option put someone's daughter down, deprive her the opportunity to dream and live big.</p>

<p> Raising from grass to grace the book of Trevor Noah, the general view is it doesn't where you come from, as long as you do whatever love and do it at your best interest, you will sit at the table and dine with the king and queens. Whanever you want something so badly, somehow the universe conspires against you, to bring it to you. I should put myself out there, never be ashamed of critism because each and every one of us should start somewhere 
	<br>
<p> "Those who have a why to live can bear with almost any how", this is a quote that I will carry with me for the rest of my life, it has taught me whenever I think of suicide or giving up in life, I should reflect on the people who look upto to me, my purpose, living upto to their expectations that should act as a source of motivation to me, fuel me to up my game, since my success is their success. I want financial stability because that will give independance, it will also help me put my family in a better place. I don't want my mom to be struggling in her old. The hope of a better tomorrow.

 <h2> <span>FINDING PURPOSE</span> </h2>		
<img src="images/sunflower.jpg" height="300" width="500" align="left">
<p>In the book <strong>Man's Search for meaning</strong> there's this quote that has really inspired me a great deal. <strong>"Those who have a 'why' to live can bear with almost any 'how'".</strong> Each one of us can relate with it in a different kind of way, in this life inorder to be strong enough to conquer our fears and the challenges we face in our day to day life however extreme it might be we must find a purpose, something that you look upto either to achieve or someone that looks upto. I have had some pretty hard time during this <strong>Covid-19 Pandemic</strong>, but since I have people looking upto me, it has been my motivation. We should be versatile, ready to change course with the flow of the wind. The waves are hard thus we need to tighten up our sails.</p>
<br>
<p> I feel for the young people who are out of school and don't have anything to engage themselves in. My advice is they should think beyond. Ask themselves the following questions, where do I want to be inspite of the pandemic? Who can serve with skills I have? How I can serve my community? Who I am? Now that I am not in school where do I want to be? What should I do? What is my purpose? What is my drive in life? Do I even have any?. Those were some of the questions I asked myself when my family couldn't afford to take me college. After I had asked myself those questions I came to a conculsion, that with the business knowledge I had gained in high school I could manage to start a small business. My brother agreed to finance me, I started with around 10 pairs of rubber shoes, it wasn't compeling since I had to arrange them on a mat at a our gate, when I made my first sales, from there henceforth I was never ashamed to sit there and do my thing.</p>
<br>
<P> I would like to tell you that the beginning is always the hardest. It's not important if you have advanced or basic skills, when it comes to something or anything that you do. You need not become a genius to succeed. All you need is your </strong>willingness</strong>. Get out of your comfort zone, it doesn't have to be business but do something that will put somewhere before covid-19 is over. If there one thing this pandemic has taught me is that never put your eggs in one basket. </p>

	Society was anything but static. Colonialism only gave new shape, meaning and direction to the
	communities’ inherent dynamism. Colonialism has had a powerful and lasting impact on Africa. The Ghanaian historian, the late Adu Boahen quoted “In some respects the impact of colonialism was deep and certainly destined to affect the future course of events, but in others, it was not”.


</p>
<br>
<p>
	One thing that caught my attention was the impact of the colonial baundaries, the boundaries were responsible for diving communities for instance it took the Turkana, the Samburu and other marginalized
communities the whole of the colonial period and even later into the post-colonial era to
realize they were in Kenya this is something we have to live with, in order for the communities to fit in we should give them a fair share in the government and since they have been lurking behind in terms of development, the gorvenment should ensure that they are nolonger left behind.
</p>
<br>
<p>
	Quoted by Sir Frederick G. Lugard, “European brains, capital and energy have not been, and never will be, expended in developing the resources of Africa from motives of pure philanthropy”. This is something we see in the kenyan leaders where a person who is in governance their only motive is to reap only, until their term is over. We can restructure this structures by ensuring that we do not vote on the basis of the tribes we come from.
</p>
<br>
<p>
Colonial commodity production, because of inappropriate practice, led to widespread environmental degradation. Forest concessions, which were granted to individuals and companies led to massive deforestation. The coloniasts are nolonger here with us hence we can't say forests are being cut to increase food production which is a good thing since different movements,ie The Green Belt Movement have emerged to support reafforestation so that we can regain our water catchment areas.
</p>
<br>
<p>
Similarly, Christian missionary activities destroyed African culture through the gospels of salvation, obedience and work. Through Western education, which they dominated despite the colonial state’s role, Christian missions preached against African cultures. This is one of the structures of colonoliasm still standing firm and alot individuals are using the church to extort money from innocent or rather desperate followers. This should stop people should learn to live their lives without looking upto someone to validate or invalidate whatever they do.
